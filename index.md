I am a Ph.D. student in [Dr. Kaden Hazzard](https://kaden.rice.edu/)'s group in [Department of Physics & Astronomy](https://physics.rice.edu/) at Rice University in Houston, Texas. Prior to embarking on this academic journey, I completed my B.Sc. in Physics from Fudan University in Shanghai, China. My research explores the intersection of quantum many-body theory and the practical engineering of quantum simulation and computing platforms, with a particular focus on ultracold fermionic atoms. Using both analytical and numerical approaches, I am committed to the advancement of fermionic quantum-classical hybrid algorithms. Additionally, I have been working on the engineering of programmable fermionic quantum simulators and understanding the physics of $SU(N>2)$ Fermi-Hubbard models. My work also extends to the study of equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties in quantum spin systems. Outside my academic pursuits, I have a diverse range of interests that span linguistics, focusing on phonetics and phonology; music, where I play the saxophone and sing; and social studies, particularly in the realms of political science and cultural studies.
