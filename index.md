I am a Ph.D. candidate in [Prof. Kaden Hazzard](https://kaden.rice.edu/)'s group in [Department of Physics & Astronomy](https://physics.rice.edu/) at Rice University in Houston, Texas. Prior to embarking on this academic journey, I completed my B.Sc. in Physics from Fudan University in Shanghai, China.

My research explores the intersection of understanding quantum many-body dynamics and designing quantum simulators, with a particular focus on programmable neutral-atom platforms such as optical tweezer arrays and lattices. Driven by the belief that deep physical insight leads to profound application, I am committed to enhancing the efficiency and robustness of quantum simulation protocols while revealing the underlying fundamental physics. My work also investigates the thermodynamics and dynamics of  $SU(N>2)$ Fermi-Hubbard physics and quantum spin systems emerging from strongly correlated matter. Specifically, I explore the role of non-local or geometrically frustrated couplings in these systems.

Outside my academic pursuits, I have a diverse range of interests that span linguistics and music.
