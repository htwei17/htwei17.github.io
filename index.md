---

I am a PhD student in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at [Rice](https://physics.rice.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Kaden Hazzard](https://kaden.rice.edu/). I am a member of the [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/) and the [Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems](https://www.aims.ox.ac.uk/) group. My research interests lie in theoretically evaluating and engineering quantum simulators by programmable ultracold atomic platforms, a topic that combines quantum many-body physics, atomic physics, and quantum information science.
