I am a Ph.D. student in [Dr. Kaden Hazzard](https://kaden.rice.edu/)'s group in [Department of Physics & Astronomy](https://physics.rice.edu/) at Rice University. Prior to joining Rice, I earned my B.Sc. degree in Physics from Fudan University in Shanghai, China. My research explores the intersection of quantum many-body theory and the practical engineering of quantum simulation and computing platforms, with a particular focus on ultracold fermionic atoms. Using analytical and numerical tools, I have been dedicated to developing novel fermionic quantum-classical hybrid algorithms, engineering programmable fermionic quantum simulators, understanding $SU(N>2)$ Fermi-Hubbard physics, and investigating the equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of quantum spin models.
