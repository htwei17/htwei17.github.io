Measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) is a concept in quantum entanglement theory. It refers to the phenomenon where the behavior of a quantum system undergoes a qualitative change due to the act of measurement. This concept is significant in understanding the dynamics of quantum entanglement and has implications for quantum computing and the simulation of quantum systems.
